# DonorsChoose

### About

Founded in 2000 by a Bronx history teacher, DonorsChoose.org has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.

### Problem Statement 

The number of days taken for funding varies from 1 to 150+days. The teacher has to wait for the funding and sometimes it can happen that total funding comes after the event and the teacher may pay the remaining amount from their own pocket. 

### Solution 

To help with the same, we designed a classification model which can tell how many days it'll take to get the funding. The teachers can use this success predictor to analyze and plan the best time to post a project. This will help to ensure teachers get funding before the requirement.

### Model Used 

I used a KNN classifier to get the prediction. The accuracy of the model was 97%.
